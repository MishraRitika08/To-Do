# Simple To-Do List Application
A straightforward to-do list application implemented using only HTML and JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and remove them when necessary. The design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.

# Getting Started
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. The application interface will enable you to add tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. You can mark a task as completed by clicking on it, and remove it from the list by clicking on the task again.

# Files
The application consists of the following files:

index.html: This HTML file structures the user interface and elements of the application.
script.js: The JavaScript file that enables the core functionality of the to-do list.
